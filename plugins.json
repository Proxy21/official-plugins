Of course, this concept itself isn\u2019t new. Plenty of great tools like 010, Hexinator and Synalyze It! have this feature (last two by the same company for different platforms). Thanks to the Kaitai Project not only for the project in general, but also for working with us to resolve some small issues while we were developing the plugin.\n\n## License\n\nThis plugin is released under a MIT license.\n\n",

        "longdescription": "The snippet editor started as a simple example UI plugin to demonstrate new features available to UI plugins. It has turned into a functionally useful plugin in its own right. The snippet editor allows you to write small bits of code that might not be big enough to warrant the effort of a full plugin but are long enough that you don't want to retype them every time in the python-console!\n\nAs an added bonus, all snippets are added to the snippets menu and hot-keys can be associated with them as they make use of the action system. All action-system items are also available through the command-palette (CTL/CMD-p).\n\n![](https://github.com/Vector35/snippets/blob/master/media/snippets.gif?raw=true)\n\n.",

Note that the [community-plugins repo](https://github.com/Vector35/community-plugins) contains a useful [utility](https://github.com/Vector35/community-plugins/blob/master/generate_plugininfo.py) to validate the plugin.json. Additionally, the [release helper](https://github.com/Vector35/release_helper) plugin is helpful for more easily pushing new releases, incrementing versions, and creating the appropriate GitHub tags.\n\nNote that originally we recommended specifying the contents of this entire file inside of the [plugin.json](./plugin.json) but the latest repository generator will use the readme contents directly which means you should simply leave an empty longdescription field. \n\n## Minimum Version\n\nThis plugin requires the following minimum version of Binary Ninja:\n\n * 3000\n\n## License\n\nThis plugin is released under an [MIT license](./license).\n\n## Metadata Version\n\n2\n",
